# NokiaRemote
NokiaRemote is a J2ME app (for Nokia 3510i however it should work on MIDP 1.0 compatible phones) to remote control Google slides.
It connects over HTTP to the [backend server](https://github.com/meyskens/nokiaremote-backend) to send commands.

This is a proof of concept, the code is not fully ready stable and secure. Use at own risk.
